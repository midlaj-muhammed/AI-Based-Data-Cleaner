🎯 PRIORITY ACTIONS:
1. Address duplicate email addresses (HIGH priority)
2. Investigate duplicate phone numbers (HIGH priority) 
3. Standardize age data format (MEDIUM priority)
4. Review join date patterns (LOW priority)

📈 DATA QUALITY SCORE: 
Based on the issues found, estimated data quality score: ~75-80%
- Positive: No missing values, no duplicate rows, consistent formatting
- Negative: Contact information duplicates, data type inconsistencies

🔧 TOOLS TO USE:
- Advanced Validation tab in the AI Data Cleaner
- Duplicate detection algorithms
- Business logic validation rules
- Data type standardization functions

⚠️  BUSINESS IMPACT:
- Contact information duplicates could affect communication
- Data integrity issues may impact reporting accuracy
- Inconsistent data types could cause processing errors
